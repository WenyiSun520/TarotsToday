Our accomplishments thus far: 
- Implemented an API interface to control which endpoints are used to access certain information
- Implemented handlers to get a tarot reading, post a tarot reading alongside a journal entry, see said readings, and see all cards
- Created database models for the users and their entries (readings, date, journal entry)
- Created a frontend for our website
- Set up authentication to allow user-specific actions
- Deployed to Azure

Before the final project presentation, we plan to:
- Clean up our code
- Clean up the nav bar
- Look into the details of only allowing one reading and entry per day
- Work on the UI of our website (example: buttons looking nicer)
